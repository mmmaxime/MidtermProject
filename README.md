Here is my Tableau link for my presentation: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/maxime.favreau/viz/MidtermProject_16729345172430/References?publish=yes

Topic: Is there a difference in heat and electricity comsumption for different government facilities in Berlin districts for the years 2018, 2019, 2020?
Needed to conduct a hypothesis to determine whether or not this is true.
Here are my hypotheses:
Null Hypothesis (H0): In the years 2018 , 2019, 2020 facility types in Berlin districts consume the same amount of heat/electricity.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): In the years 2018, 2019, 2020 facility types in Berlin districts consume different amounts of heat/electricity.
P-value for heat: 0.12001258160006334
P-value for electricity/power: 0.10143594256638956
Results: We failed to reject the null hypothesis
